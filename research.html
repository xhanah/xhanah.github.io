		<p>Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) encapsulation has been widely used in the electronic applications of two-dimensional (2D) materials to improve device performance by protecting 2D materials against contamination and degradation. It is often assumed that hBN layers as a dielectric would not affect the electronic structure of encapsulated 2D materials. We found that the measured downshift of the E<sub>2g</sub><sup>1</sup> mode does not decrease with increasing the thickness of MoS<sub>2</sub>, which can be attributed to tensile strains in bilayer and trilayer MoS<sub>2</sub> caused by the typical experimental process of the hBN encapsulation. We estimated the strain magnitude and found that the induced strain may cause the K–Q crossover in the conduction band of few-layer MoS<sub>2</sub>, so greatly modifying its electronic properties as an n-type semiconductor. Our study suggests that the hBN encapsulation should be used with caution, as it may affect the electronic properties of encapsulated few-layer 2D materials.

		<p>Bandgap engineering offers opportunities for tailoring the properties of semiconductor materials for desired applications in microelectronics and optoelectronics. Alloys of different semiconductor materials can lead to the continuously tuning of the bandgap. Here, we report the bandgap engineering in layered InSe single crystals by substituting the Se atoms with S atoms. The formation of InS<sub>x</sub>Se<sub>1−x</sub> single crystal alloy with x ≤ 0.3 is evidenced by the X-ray diffraction and resonant Raman spectra. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra peak position blue shifts from ∼1.27 to ∼1.42 eV as S composition increases from 0 to 0.3 in the alloys, which is consistent with the bandgap shifts calculated by density functional theory. Temperature dependence of the PL spectra indicate that the presence of S atoms decreases the strength of the electron−phonon interaction but increases the average phonon energy in InS<sub>x</sub>Se<sub>1−x</sub> alloys. Our findings will open an intriguing avenue in understanding the fundamental physics in the III−VI layered semiconductor materials and their potential applications in optoelectronic devices.

		<p>This project is intended to order 33 images of the same person but with different face directions. Several manifold learning techniques were employed (e.g. Diffusion Map etc.). After comparing the results, we found that locally linear embedding performed better than others in which number of components and neighbors are 2 and 5, respectively. We also conducted experiments to compare the performance depending on hyper-parameter (number of components), by changing the number of neighbors from 5 to 10. It was discovered that 5 neighbors provided the best model performance.
