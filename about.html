		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>I obtained my bachelor degree of science from Renmin University of China in 2017. I'm now pursing my Ph.D. degree towards computational physics in the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. I'm currently working in Prof. <a href="http://angstrom.ust.hk">Ding Pan's group</a> in computational materials science. For details about my research, please see <a href="research.html">here</a>.</p>
		<p>I was born in January, 1996 in Yangzhou, Jiangsu Province and grew up there until 2013. Then I moved to Beijing to start my undergraduate study. Thanks to Renmin University of China, to 132, I was lucky to have acquaintance with my three roommates. From time to time, I can record those moments that we got up early for the 8 a.m. class, stayed up late to attend the World of Warcraft (WOW) film premiere or even fight for a victory in Dota2.</p>
		<p>In the mean while, I felt so fortunate to join Prof. <a href="http://www.phys.ruc.edu.cn/contents/24/120.html">Rong Yu's group</a> to conduct independent research until my grduation. In the fall semester of 2016, I moved to L.A. to visit Prof. <a href="http://physics1.usc.edu/ccm/">Stephan Haas's group</a> in University of Southern California. My research at that time was focused on studying the 1D Ising model and Heisenburg model by computational methods, in order to make comparisons with neutron-scattering experiments. </p> 
		<p>After graduation in 2017, I have been in Hong Kong until now. Apart from physics, I learned machine learning techniques both in campus and from online sources. In CSIC:5011: Data Reduction & Visulization, I worked together with two group members to finish <a href="research.html">a project via manifold learning</a> and won <a href="https://yao-lab.github.io/2019_csic5011/project2/BestWriting.pdf">Best Writing Award</a> and <a href="https://yao-lab.github.io/2019_csic5011/project2/BestPresentation.pdf">Best Presentation Award</a>.</p>
		<p>I hope to graduate in 2021 and find a job as a quantitative researcher or data scientist. Comparing to these above, captain in always my dream job. However, due to my poor eyesight, I could only pursue that in my next life.</p>
		<p>I am fond of exercising in the gym and taking photographs. Most of the card games are also my cuisines.</p>
